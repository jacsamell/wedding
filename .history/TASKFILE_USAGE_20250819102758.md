# Taskfile Usage Guide

Simple task runner with just 3 core commands for your wedding website.

## Installation

If you don't have Task installed:

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install go-task/tap/go-task
```

## Commands

```bash
task start    # Start development server
task build    # Build website and Lambda functions  
task deploy   # Deploy to AWS (builds first)
```

## What Each Task Does

### `task start`
- Runs `npm run dev`
- Starts Vite development server on localhost:3000

### `task build` 
- Builds the frontend website (`npm run build`)
- Builds Lambda deployment packages for RSVP and Spotify APIs

### `task deploy`
- Runs `task build` first automatically
- Initializes/updates Terraform
- Shows deployment plan
- Applies infrastructure changes
- Deploys both website and Lambda functions

## Prerequisites

Create `terraform/terraform.tfvars` from the example file and fill in your values:
```bash
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars
```

Make sure you have AWS CLI configured with proper permissions.

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# Start developing
task start

# When ready to deploy
task deploy
```

That's it! Simple and clean.
